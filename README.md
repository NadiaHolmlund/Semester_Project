# Semester_Project

ver_0: Working pipeline for training and testing the model using HuggingFace Trainer

ver_1: Implementation of MLFlow in ver_0 pipeline for experiment tracking

ver_2: Implementation of MLFlow in ver_0 pipeline for experiment tracking, new approach compared to ver_1

ver_3: Aborted for now. Simplifying to model by excluding the forward pass (attempt to reduce size, complexity and allowing to make predictions on individual images for PoC Streamlit application). Builds on ver_2.




PoC_ver_0_Streamlit: Creating the code pipeline for making predictions on the Streamlit application.
