# Semester_Project

ver_0: Working pipeline for training and testing the model using HuggingFace Trainer

ver_1: Implementation of MLFlow in ver_0 pipeline for experiment tracking

ver_2: Implementation of MLFlow in ver_0 pipeline for experiment tracking, new approach compared to ver_1

ver_3: **APPROVED WORKING CODE - NEEDS CLEANUP**. Simplifying to model by excluding the forward pass (attempt to reduce size, complexity and allowing to make predictions on individual images for PoC Streamlit application). Builds on ver_2.

ver_4: To be clean version of ver_3. Should be ready for hand-in once done.


PoC_ver_0_Streamlit: Creating the code pipeline for making predictions on the Streamlit application.
