# BDS Semester Project

## Business Data Science - Semester Project - Exam

This project was completed after module 7 on the Data Science programme and represents the culmination of our efforts during the second semester. During this project, our team had the opportunity to develop a transformer model for facial emotion recognition.

The project involves the fine-tuning process of three pre-trained vision models, including ViT from Google, Beit from Microsoft and Deit from Facebook. The models have been fine-tuned using various training arguments for experimentation purposes.

The project resulted in a platform called MoodTrackr (DEMO version), which enables users to track their emotions when interacting with various websites and online media.
